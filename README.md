# DolapCase
## Decisions
1. MVC design pattern used for the design structure.
2. Stacks are used in storyboard for keeping the ui elements aligned
3. Product info part has a fixed size and the rest of the screen is used for the image as aspect fill.
4. Counter is created using CAShapeLayer's and UIBezierPath.
5. Displaying and updating a counter is available as an extension to UIView class.
6. Localization for alerts and label texts is available for English and Turkish languages.
